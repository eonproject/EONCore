 * @brief The message struct defines a blockchain message

 * Messages are the heart of all activity on the blockchain,
 * -- all events and actions which take place in the chain are
 * recorded as messages. Messages are sent from one account 
 * (@ref sender) to another account (@ref recipient), and are
 * optionally also delivered to several other accounts (@ref notify_accounts).
 *
 * A message has a header that defines who sent it and who will 
 * be processing it. The message content is a binary blob,
 * @ref data, whose type is determined by @ref type, which is 
 * dynamic and defined by the scripting language.
